```java
/**
 * Constructor-based or setter-based DI?
 *
 * The Spring team generally advocates constructor injection as it enables one to implement application components as
 * immutable objects and to ensure that required dependencies are not null. Furthermore constructor-injected components
 * are always returned to client (calling) code in a fully initialized state. As a side note, a large number of
 * constructor arguments is a bad code smell, implying that the class likely has too many responsibilities and should be
 * refactored to better address proper separation of concerns.
